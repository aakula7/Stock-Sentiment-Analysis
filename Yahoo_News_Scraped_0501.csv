A Valve employee posted an update to the company’s SteamVR forums, noting that “SteamVR has ended macOS support so our team can focus on Windows and Linux.”Apple  introduced “Metal for VR” back in June 2017 and highlighted a partnership with Valve. At the time, Valve was pushing VR as a platform and working with HTC on its Vive system; fast-forward to 2020 and Valve has its own high-end headset and has just released its highly-anticipated title “Half Life: Alyx.”This impacts developers more so than actual gamers.Almost no games supported Mac, and even Apple’s highest-end MacBook Pros failed to meet minimum specification requirements for Oculus or SteamVR. As the folks at Upload point out, Valve’s recent hardware survey showcases that just 4% of gamers on the platform use macOS to begin with, suggesting a pretty small sliver of actual gamers even fit in the Mac-owning VR user Venn diagram.Game developers building VR content on Mac likely enjoyed the ability to develop and test on a single machine. As Apple aggressively chases professionals with high-priced gear like the Mac Pro and iMac Pro, it’s not a great look when a major software platform decides you’re not worth the effort.San FranciscoSep 14 - 16See all newsletters(opens in a new window)Valve is calling it quits on macOS support for its virtual reality platform.

News late in the session that the U.S. Food and Drug Administration had granted Gilead’s antiviral treatment remdesivir emergency use authorization to treat patients with COVID-19 did little to move the needle on equities.Earlier, earnings results from some of the most heavily weighted companies in the major U.S. stock indices came in mixed. Amazon (AMZN) posted first-quarter sales that jumped 26% over last year, but warned that $4 billion in expected coronavirus-related costs could drag operating income negative to the tune of $1.5 billion.Meanwhile, Apple (AAPL) reported quarterly revenue growth that slowed dramatically over last year, and declined to offer an outlook for the first time in years due to uncertainty over the pandemic. The tech-heavy Nasdaq ended Friday’s session lower by 3.2%Oil giants Exxon Mobil and Chevron each posted weaker results compared to last year as the economic devastation from the coronavirus and recent plunge in crude oil prices weighed on the companies. Exxon Mobil posted its first quarterly loss in decades, and Chevron cut its capital expenditure plans for the year by another $2 billion. A day earlier, the S&P 500 closed out April with its best monthly gain since 1987. The blue-chip index climbed a total of 12.68% for the month, but was still off 14% from its record high on February 19, and down nearly 10% year to date.“We forecast further gains in most risky assets between now and the end of next year. This reflects our expectation of a rebound in economic activity starting in the second half of 2020, alongside the continuation of massive monetary and fiscal policy support,” John Higgins, chief markets economist for Capital Economics, wrote in a note Thursday.“Admittedly, risky assets have already recovered quite a lot of the ground that they lost after the outbreak of coronavirus. And two key downside risks remain,” he added.“First, success in containing the virus could be reversed as economies reopen. Second, the consensus for policy support might break down,” he said. “But assuming these risks do not materialize, we anticipate that the rally will continue.”Still, equities are entering what has historically been a tougher six-month period in terms of comparable returns.During that time frame, the S&P 500 have averaged returns of just 1.5% during the May through October period since 1950, according to LPL Research data, and ended the period higher just 64.3% of the time. In more recent history, however, stocks produced positive gains in seven of the past eight six-month periods between May and October, and as much as 10% during the similar period in 2013.The recent stock rally comes despite mounting evidence of the damage the coronavirus pandemic and social distancing measures have inflicted on the domestic economy. A government report Thursday showed another 3.8 million Americans filed for new unemployment claims last week, bringing the total over the past six weeks to more than 30 million.—Here’s where the three major indices settled, as of 4:06 p.m. ET:—The U.S. Food and Drug administration confirmed President Donald Trump’s earlier remarks that Gilead’s remdesivir antiviral treatment received emergency use authorization for the coronavirus disease for hospitalized patients, according to a statement Friday.—President Donald Trump told reporters Friday that Gilead received emergency use authorization for its anti-viral treatment to be used for patients with COVID-19, according to reports from multiple outlets.Gilead’s stock pared losses of more than 5% earlier in the session to trade about 4% lower, or at about $80 per share.—West Texas intermediate (WTI) crude oil prices rose for a third straight session to settle at a two-week high of $19.78 per barrel. Friday’s gain marked an advance of 5%, or 94 cents per barrel. The commodity’s weekly gain was 14.6%.Friday’s settlement – the first in May – comes on the heels of a crushing April for crude, with WTI futures at one point turning negative for the first time in history. The commodity had shed 8% for the month of April, and remains lower by 68% for the year to date.—Tesla’s (TSLA) stock extended earlier declines Friday morning, dropping more than 7% to below $730 per share as of 11:18 a.m. ET, after the electric car-maker’s Elon Musk wrote in a Twitter post that Tesla’s stock price was “too high.”Tesla’s stock was up nearly 87% for the year to date through Thursday’s close, far outperforming the broader market. The remarks were part of a series of tweets Musk released over a 10-minute period Friday morning. The billionaire also said that he is “selling almost all physical possessions” and will “own no house.” In a Twitter subsequent Twitter post, he said, “Now give people back their FREEDOM.”Earlier this week, Tesla reported first-quarter sales growth over last year and an unexpected profit. However, the company has been contending with a weekslong temporary suspension of operations at its flagship Fremont, California factory and New York facility amid the COVID-19 pandemic, potentially pressuring results in the current quarter. During a call Wednesday with analysts and investors, Musk went on an expletive-laden diatribe calling for social distancing measures to be quickly rolled back.—The Institute for Supply Management’s (ISM) manufacturing purchasing managers’ index (PMI) slid to 41.5 in April from 49.1 in March. The result was slightly above consensus estimates for a drop to 36.0, however, according to Bloomberg data.Subindices measuring production, new orders and employment each fell at faster paces relative to March. Prints below the neutral level of 50 indicate contraction in activity.“Comments from the panel were strongly negative (three negative comments for every one positive comment) regarding the near-term outlook, with sentiment clearly impacted by the coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic and continuing energy market recession,” ISM said in a statement. “The PMI indicates a level of manufacturing-sector contraction not seen since April 2009, with a strongly negative trajectory.”—IHS Markit’s final U.S. manufacturing PMI for April sank to 36.1 from 48.5, hitting the lowest reading since March 2009 and falling for a second consecutive month.Beneath the headline index, manufacturing output slumped to 28.8 in April from 46.5 in March, representing a record decline. Readings below the neutral level of 50 indicate contraction in a sector. Meanwhile, new orders fell versus the prior month to the lowest level since January 2009.""April saw the manufacturing sector struck hard by the COVID-19 pandemic, with output falling to an extent surpassing that seen even at the height of the global financial crisis. With orders collapsing at a rate not seen for over a decade, supply chains disrupted to a record degree and pessimism about the outlook hitting a new survey high, rising numbers of firms are culling payroll numbers,” Chris Williamson, chief business economist at IHS Markit, said in a statement.—Here were the main moves in markets, as of 9:33 a.m. ET:—Quarterly results from oil majors Exxon Mobil (XOM) and Chevron (CVX) reflected the early impact of the misery in oil markets at the corporate level.Exxon Mobil reported its first quarterly loss in at least 32 years, with losses totaling $610 million for the first three months of the year versus income of $2.4 billion in the same quarter a year ago. However, the company departed from other major oil companies in sticking to its previously announced plans to cut capital expenditures by $10 billion to $23 billion for the year.Chevron, on the other hand, cut its capital expenditures plans again following crude oil prices’ April slump. The company cut its capex plans buy $2 billion to $14 billion, after originally planning capex to come in at $20 billion for the year. These reductions are mostly going to hit Chevron’s shale production, with activity in both the Permian Basin and Canada getting slashed. Refining operations are also going to bear some of that cut. While Chevron eked out a first-quarter profit, its results highlighted some of the demand destruction for downstream products that have resulted from the coronavirus pandemic. Jet fuel demand was down 75%, and diesel demand dropped 25%, the company said in a presentation Friday.—Here were the main moves in markets ahead of the opening bell, as of 7:24 a.m. ET:—Stock futures pointed to a lower open on Friday, as investors braced for more earnings and data that are all but certain to show how badly the coronavirus has stifled global growth.Here were the main moves at the start of the overnight session for U.S. equity futures, as of 6:02 p.m. ET:—Follow Yahoo Finance on Twitter, Facebook, Instagram, Flipboard, LinkedIn, and reddit.Find live stock market quotes and the latest business and finance newsFor tutorials and information on investing and trading stocks, check out Cashay"
2,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/what-is-smartphone-contact-tracing-tech-support-140812773.html,2020-05-01T14:08:12.000Z,What is smartphone contact tracing and how does it work? Tech Support,"Welcome to Tech Support, a segment where I, Dan Howley, serve as your intrepid guide through the sometimes confusing, often frustrating, world of personal technology. Here, I answer all of your most pressing questions about the various gizmos, gadgets, and services you use in your everyday life.Have a question of your own? Reach me on Twitter at @danielhowley, or email me at dhowley@yahoofinance.com.Now, on to your questions.This week's dilemma:Smartphone contract tracing is a means of quickly notifying people via their phone that they have been in contact with somebody who has an illness such as coronavirus.Without smartphones, healthcare officials traditionally perform contact tracing by interviewing infected individuals to determine where they’ve traveled and whom they’ve contacted. Health officials then reach out to those individuals so they can quarantine themselves.But traditional contact tracing requires serious human resources, including workers manning phone lines to reach out to potentially infected people, individuals going door-to-door, etc. According to The New York Times, a nationwide effort would likely require somewhere around 300,000 people. What’s more, this kind of tracing takes time — something authorities can’t afford with a fast-spreading virus.In place of such a massive workforce, countries around the world have begun to develop and deploy smartphone-based contact tracing systems.The Chinese government, for instance, uses an app that residents are required to download if they want to use things like shopping malls and public transportation. Singapore, meanwhile, used a voluntary smartphone app called TraceTogether that measures the distance a person’s phone has been from another person’s device using Bluetooth technology. Data is stored locally on users’ phones unless they authorize its upload to the country’s Ministry of Health.European countries like Germany have sought to have data collected via smartphone apps uploaded to a centralized database that would give the country’s health officials a better understanding of the virus, but at the potential expense of user privacy.The fear is that governments could use the data gleaned from their centralized contact tracing apps to effectively set up a mass surveillance program. Germany has since abandoned this route.A number of proposals for apps in the U.S. would allow for smartphone contact tracing, including one developed by the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. But the most likely candidate for nationwide smartphone contact tracing is the solution put together by Apple (AAPL) and Google (GOOG, GOOGL), which they refer to as an “exposure notification” tool.The smartphone contact tracing system comes with controversy – user privacy is certainly a concern among some security experts.The Apple-Google tool will enable our phones to communicate with each other, and alert us if we’ve come into contact with someone with the coronavirus.Rather than depending on a users’ GPS data, which can identify individuals, the tool will rely on Bluetooth, similar to Singapore’s solution.Initially, the companies will require users to download an app from an official health authority, but that will change when they provide operating system updates that allow you to activate it without a third-party app.When activated, and doing so is voluntary, the tool will randomly generate identifier beacons for you and every user accessing the system. When you come into contact with another person using the tool, your devices will exchange these Bluetooth beacons, which are essentially a string of otherwise meaningless numbers that change every 10 to 20 minutes to thwart malicious actors from tracking individuals using the identifiers.Any identifiers you come in contact with will be saved in a secure portion of your device, and remain there. If you become infected with the coronavirus, you can use your compatible health authority’s app to update your infection status. Your device will then fire off your randomized identifier beacons to a server where they’ll be held for a limited time.If you’re not infected, your device will download a list of randomized identifier beacons associated with infected users daily. Those beacons will then be compared, on your device, with beacons your phone has come in contact with. If they match up, you’ll receive an alert through your health authority’s app saying you may have been exposed to coronavirus.    Both Apple and Google say this data will be unusable by them, and won’t be monetized. They also say the data associated with the randomized Bluetooth beacons will be encrypted.Apple and Google won’t be the ones administering the tracing apps, either. Instead, your local health authority will be in charge of that, though the data protections the companies put in place will still be used regardless of the authority.It’s important to note that this is all voluntary, and Apple and Google say they’ll turn off the service as the pandemic subsides. The companies say only health authorities will be able to interface with the data, and that neither Apple nor Google will have access to it.Both companies are also making their solutions available in all of their markets, including Germany, which has said it will use the tool.We’ll find out more about the tracing system when it becomes available this month. More from Dan:Got a tip?

But just like in baseball, even the greatest investors strike out now and then.Read more: Warren Buffett: Lessons from a legendary investor“I've made so many mistakes, if I tried to kick myself, my legs would be exhausted,” Buffett told Yahoo Finance’s Andy Serwer in a March 10 interview at Berkshire Hathaway’s headquarters in Omaha, Nebraska. “You don't kick yourself when you make a mistake. I mean, it is part of what you do. And you know, I was there when Ted Williams batted .406.”Williams, the legendary Red Sox left fielder, achieved that batting average in 1941. And he has since been the last baseball player to bat above .400 since. Keep in mind: that means for every 10 at bats, he didn’t make it on base six of those times.Similarly, great investing comes with its fair share of missed opportunities and wrong way bets. And Buffett is no stranger to this.A couple of those big missed opportunities for Buffett include mega-cap tech names like Amazon (AMZN) and Alphabet (GOOGL).When asked why he didn’t invest in Google before the company went public, Buffett said, “Well, that's a pretty damn good question. But I don't have a good answer. I definitely should've owned Google.”Meanwhile, Amazon’s massive success and meteoric stock are things he and his vice chairman Charlie Munger continue to wrestle with.“Those are the kind of businesses I think about a lot. Charlie thinks about them a lot. You can't help but do it. I mean, those are incredible business stories.”Big tech stocks, or the so-called “FAANG” names, have been on a tear, even as the COVID-19 outbreak created an extremely volatile market environment.“You're seeing in this kind of a market, those companies don't need capital. Well, Netflix needs capital. But basically, the big companies in market value don't need capital. And that will separate them even more from the rest of the pack. I mean, they have an incredible business model,” Buffett said.And it’s never too late to revisit one of those missed opportunities, according to Buffett. “Well, actually, one of the other fellows [at Berkshire] now has bought a little Amazon.”Catch more of Buffett’s investing know-how on May 2 at the Berkshire Hathaway’s Annual Shareholders meeting, streamed exclusively on Yahoo Finance. —Heidi Chung is a reporter at Yahoo Finance.

By month’s end, more than 1.06 million cases had been confirmed.The death toll in the country has topped 60,000; on April 1, fewer than 5,000 COVID-related deaths had been recorded. Bodies are piling up outside funeral homes in New York. Experts believe COVID-related deaths in the U.S. have been severely undercounted.Job losses have been staggering. In the past four weeks more than 20 million Americans have filed for unemployment insurance. Next week’s jobs report is expected to show the unemployment rate climbing into the double-digits in April.GDP data published Wednesday showed the first quarter marked the biggest contraction in economic growth since 2008. The second quarter will be worse. In April, the price of oil went negative and the IMF coined a startling new term to describe our economic moment — The Great Lockdown.And all the while stocks rallied aggressively.The Dow rallied some 10.5% in April, to log its best April performance since 1938. The S&P 500 gained more than 12% and enjoyed its best month since January 1987. The Nasdaq gained the most since April 2001.And while whether the stock market is a good representation of the broader economy is an eternal debate in the business world, April’s judgment was clear: stocks did not reflect April’s lived experience.Of course, the job of financial markets is not to assess the present but discount the future. Investors are focused not on realized but anticipated changes in the economy, on whether things will get better or get worse from here.As we wrote last week, some experts are seeing signs that economic data will not likely get worse from here. Comments from corporate executives this week also suggested as much.Facebook (FB) CFO David Wehner said Wednesday, “After an initial steep decrease in ad revenue in March, we have seen signs of stability reflected in the first 3 weeks of April. Ad revenue has been approximately flat compared to the same period a year ago.” On Thursday, Apple (AAPL) CEO Tim Cook told Bloomberg TV that sales started to “pick up” in the second half of April.Skeptics, of course, are not in short supply. A near consensus view among investors has been that the March 23 lows will eventually be re-tested. And indeed they may.But at least in April the old adage that the market will try to make fools of the largest possible number of participants held true.In the months ahead, the most important variable for investors will be containment of the spread of the coronavirus and progress on potential treatments or a vaccine. As JPMorgan’s John Normand outlined in a note published Thursday, the market’s emerging dominant narrative is “starting to latch onto rapid development of COVID-19 therapeutics and hopes for a vaccine, and therefore fewer public health risks to reopening economies and a quicker return to normalcy.”“This evolving theme is already evident in the news flow, which has been flat-lining throughout April for topics like infections and recession, while accelerating around topics like therapeutics and vaccines,” Normand adds.Re-opening economies, of course, remains a fraught endeavor. Strategists at UBS earlier this week said they expect stocks would fall below their March 23 lows if lockdown restrictions being lifted now are reinstated later this year on account of a renewed spread of the virus.And as the equity derivatives team at Bank of America Global Research wrote earlier this week, “history suggests it would be highly unlikely for the S&P not to re-test its [March 23] lows given both the size of its recent drawdown and the fact a recession is underway.The firm asks, however, if the four most dangerous words in investing may indeed apply.“However,” BofA strategists write, “the speed of the recent bear rally on the back of record and rapid policy stimulus has some wondering if this time is different?”By Myles Udland, reporter and co-anchor of The Final Round.

      , the second-largest company by market capitalization in the S&P 500, ended the session down 7.6% after it said late Thursday it topped $75 billion in sales in the first quarter as COVID-19 swept across the globe, but profit declined and the company said it might lose money in the current period as it spends to keep up with demand. Both Apple and  Amazon are among the companies that led the S&P 500 index’s comeback from the March 23 lows and were two of the best performers in April. Amazon rallied nearly 27% in April while Apple jumped 15%.The magnitude of the rebound from the market’s March 23 lows also has left valuations at very high levels during a time when the ongoing coronavirus epidemic makes forecasting future corporate profits difficult. The S&P 500 ended Friday with a forward price-to-earnings multiple of 19.8, well above historical averages, according to FactSet.Meanwhile, global equities were pressured after President Donald Trump indicated he may consider imposing import tariffs on China. The Washington Post on Thursday reported that U.S. officials are beginning to explore proposals for punishing China for its handling of the pandemic, including punitive import tariffs, adding to bearish sentiment on Wall Street. “Supply chains were already in a tough place given the pressure to global growth, the lack of transport of goods around the world, and hearing that there could be even more strains to supply chains in the form of tariffs is rightfully being priced into the market negatively,” Miskin said.Stocks saw little movement after the Institute for Supply Management said its April manufacturing index came in at 41.5%.  Economists surveyed by MarketWatch, on average, had looked for the gauge to plunge to 35% from a 49.1% reading in March.

            Microsoft,
Amazon.com,
Apple,
Alphabet,
      and
            Facebook
      —all reported earnings. They also happen to be the five largest companies in the S&P 500, so the results mattered—a lot. The news was better than feared, though plenty of questions remain. Here are my five takeaways:  What bear market? While the
        S&P 500
      was still down 10% year to date through Thursday’s close, the tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite is basically back to flat. Most of the credit goes to the tech giants. In April, the S&P 500 rallied 12%, and big tech still managed to outperform, led by gains of 23% for Facebook (ticker: FB) and 27% for Amazon (AMZN). As I wrote in mid-March, all five of these companies will exit the crisis stronger than they began. They have sterling balance sheets, dominant market positions, and smart management. The crisis is only accelerating their lead. Apple has 550 million subscribers to various services. Microsoft’s (MSFT) Azure cloud is growing revenue at nearly 60% a year. In just a few weeks, Amazon hired 175,000 people. And Facebook just hit 3 billion users—nearly 40% of the earth’s population. The big are getting bigger. Better than advertise d. Digital advertising was one of the primary worries for the internet sector heading into earnings season. Airlines, hotels, retailers, restaurants, and movie studios—all large online ad buyers—have little reason to promote themselves, while small businesses are focused on conserving cash. The quarter’s biggest surprise was that Google’s parent Alphabet (GOOGL) and Facebook both said that advertising demand had stabilized in April. Pivotal Research analyst Michael Levine, who had been deeply bearish on Facebook, was so shocked that he backed away from his Sell rating, upgrading the stock to Hold. Results, he said were “far better” than anyone had anticipated. He says that weakness in sectors such as travel and small business were offset by strength in direct-to-consumer retail brands, technology, and gaming. Both Facebook and Alphabet warned that risks remain, that the June quarter would be tougher, and that extrapolating from April is risky. But, for now, online advertising is proving more resilient than expected. Backing buybacks. In previewing Apple (AAPL) earnings this past week on Barrons.com, I noted that Apple was likely to announce a new buyback plan. One reader sent me a handful of emails doubting that Apple would double down on stock repurchases, noting that they have become a political hot potato. In fact, much of the corporate world has suspended buyback programs. But not big tech. Alphabet bought back $8.5 billion of stock in the quarter, a record quarterly haul; Microsoft repurchased $6 billion, and Apple bought back $18.6 billion, while raising its dividend 6%. Apple also announced a $50 billion buyback program, on top of its existing $40 billion authorization. Investors want repurchases, and I would defend the companies’ right to make them. They’re still hiring people, they spend freely on research and development, they have ample cash, and they continue to generate lots more. None of them is taking government stimulus dollars. Why shouldn’t they buy back shares? In search of guidance. At this point, I’m not sure why some companies are still providing guidance. Apple pulled back its forecast in February, and every analyst overcorrected. The company ultimately beat the consensus revenue estimate by almost $4 billion. Microsoft had also warned that its original forecast for its PC segment would be too high. The warning proved unnecessary. That segment’s revenues were right in line with the original prediction. For now, there is no winning anyway.
            Intel 
      (INTC) pulled its full-year guidance and got punished;
            Advanced Micro Devices 
      (AMD) bravely issued a full-year outlook, but it was below its previous forecast, so its stock was punished, too. This past week, Apple decided not to give guidance for its June quarter. Investors might not have liked it, but the fact is no one knows what’s coming.  June swoon? It’s good news that big tech did better than expected in the March quarter. But let’s remember that it was mid-March or later before the shutdowns really started. The economic pain didn’t hit full force until the current quarter. Amazon says it could be breakeven or worse in the June quarter, as the company ramps up Covid-19 related spending. Apple says that iPhone sales will be materially worse. The ad recoveries at Facebook and Alphabet are nice, but year-over-year comparisons in June are going to look worse than March’s. Microsoft’s cloud business looks strong, but the company won’t be insulated from a deep recession. No one will be. So it’s fine to breathe a sigh of relief over the first quarter. But keep your mask on; we’re not done yet. Write to Eric J.

No, not the batteries, nor the motorist's best friend, I'm talking about Amazon (AMZN) , Advanced Micro Devices  (AMD)  , and Apple (AAPL) .When I do my checks on what stocks confounded most of you, these three keep coming up.So let's spend some time on them to see if their declines after reporting make any sense.First, Amazon, the A in FANG, reported a blowout top line but a disappointing bottom line; it seems like it just isn't making enough money on those sales.The truth? It isn't and it isn't by design. The company could have made $4 billion in profit, CEO and founder Jeff Bezos said, but it has to deal with the pandemic and says he will spend all of that and maybe even more to keep his workers safe and the company functioning in a way that makes it reliable for all. ""If you are a shareholder in Amazon you may want to take a seat, because we're not thinking small,"" Bezos told us after the quarter.I think these are words that can't be dismissed idly because many of you may want to be excused while the pandemic rages and Bezos and company spend as they must. We have had periods where Amazon is in investment mode and you had to just hold on until it was over. When it was over, though, Amazon was able to pull out all of the stops and just make fortunes for shareholders.This time is different. He's not spending to make money. He spending to deal with the pandemic, which is why I think he was so circumscribed in his commentary.The revenues tell you that the product is in relentless demand. But there was one area I was a bit disappointed in: Amazon Web Services, which only grew by 33%. I know it sounds weird to say ""only"" before 33% but I thought you could get mid-40s growth. Is Microsoft's (MSFT) Azure taking share? How about Alphabet's (GOOGL) Google Cloud as it's run by a terrific exec, Thomas Kurian, who is hellbent on taking share.Whatever, what matters is that this company's just too good not to own. My advice: buy it as it comes in.Apple's a quandary. The company reported a terrific quarter but then gave no guidance. Too uncertain. When it announced that it would give no guidance the stock got hit in after hours last night but then it was decked when the president let out word that it might be time to take action against the Chinese because of the handling of the story about the coronavirus, something that's pretty much universally accepted as suboptimal. I think that Apple's right to give no guidance and it wasn't a sign of pending weakness. It was just an awareness of the dicey time we are in. Companies don't increase dividends and buybacks if they are worried about the future. Apple did both.When I spoke to Tim Cook he confirmed to me that the stay in place economy's actually good for Apple because Apple owns the home but not the enterprise. The coalescence of home and enterprise that comes from the Work From Home movement plays right into Apple's hands.If I weren't so near-term negative about the market I would tell you to buy it Monday morning. The stock was rallying before the market got crushed today. The pull of the S&P was just too great. So let's wait a bit, until the market gets less overbought if you don't already own it. Nothing's changed for me, own Apple, don't trade it, remains my mantra.Finally there is AMD and this is the easiest of the three. AMD had an amazing quarter with good demand in gaming, data center, and notebooks. I think this quarter will be even better. The company was so confident of its future that it guided to 25% growth. Knowing the CEO Lisa Su, as I do, I know that's conservative. Nevertheless, the analysts put pen to paper and decided it was a guidedown and then postulated that AMD was losing share to a renewed Intel (INTC) .Here's my take: AMD is doing extraordinarily well. It has fabulous chips in great categories with fantastic customers. Things will only get better. That's why of the three I think you can start buying this one on Monday. I'm not calling it a bottom, I am saying that it's gotten overly punished given the greatness of Su and the relentless turn at AMD.(Amazon, Apple, Microsoft and Alphabet are holdings in Jim Cramer's Action Alerts PLUS member club.

(NASDAQ:AMZN), a holding of Berkshire, announcing in a first-quarter earnings release that the Seattle-based e-commerce giant plans to spend its entire expected second-quarter operating profit of $4 billion on coronavirus-related expenses ""getting products to customers and keeping employees safe,"" according to CEO Jeff Bezos.Likewise, Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL), the top holding of Berkshire based on the December 2019 13-F filing, said on Wednesday that due to the uncertainty regarding the virus, the Cupertino, California-based tech giant skipped its June-quarter earnings guidance despite reporting adjusted earnings that topped consensus estimates.Market is coming off strong month of April, Buffett indicator rises back above 130%The Dow Jones advanced over 11% during the month of April on hopes for a potential treatment of the Covid-19 virus and the reopening of the economy as the number of new cases starts declining.As the markets rise from the all-time lows during late March, the ratio of total market cap to gross domestic product soared above 130%, yet is still approximately 20% below the all-time high.Based on the current market valuation level, the expected market return over the next eight years is approximately -0.4% per year assuming a reversion to the mean level of 80%. According to the predicted and actual returns chart, the expected return ranges from -8.2% per year in the most-pessimistic case to 4.50% in the most-optimistic case.GuruFocus' Interactive Chart allows users to visualize historical valuationsThe following video explores how GuruFocus Premium users can visualize historical valuations using the Interactive Chart. Two key built-in chart templates are the Peter Lynch Chart and the price-sales valuation bands chart.Legendary investor Peter Lynch, who managed the Fidelity Magellan Fund during the 1980s, developed a quick way to determine if a stock is undervalued or overvalued: Compare the price line to an earnings line based on a price-earnings ratio of 15. Figure 1 illustrates a sample Peter Lynch Chart for Coca-Cola Co. (NYSE:KO), Berkshire's third-largest holding as of the December 2019 filing.Figure 1As Figure 1 illustrates, Coca-Cola's price line is above the Peter Lynch earnings line, suggesting possible overvaluation.Lynch warned that cyclical companies like Amazon and Apple might have high profit margins at the peak of business cycles, resulting in artificially-low price-earnings ratios. Coca-Cola, on the other hand, is in the consumer defensive sector and thus the Atlanta-based beverage company's profit margins are not as sensitive to changes in the business cycle.Unlike the price-earnings ratio, the price-sales ratio is less impacted by cyclicality and, therefore, more accurately compares current valuations to historical valuations. Buffett's market indicator of total market cap to gross domestic product is like a price-sales ratio, with the total market cap representing the price of the U.S. market and gross domestic product as the total sales of the U.S. market. Figure 2 illustrates a sample price-sales valuation bands chart for Apple.Figure 2As Figure 2 illustrates, Apple's price line is near the midpoint of the two valuation bands, suggesting fair valuation.Disclosure: The author is long Apple as of this writing. The discussion of Berkshire's portfolio holdings in this article is based on the conglomerate's December 2019 13-F and does not consider any trades made during the first quarter of 2020. Per Securities and Exchange Commission regulations, the deadline to report quarterly portfolios is 45 days after the quarter ends.Read more here:Not a Premium Member of GuruFocus?

        S&P 500
      and
        Dow Jones Industrial Average,
      respectively, each finished their best month in 33 years. But the momentum faded the first day in May, as all three major indexes tumbled into the red. The Dow declined 622.03 points, or 2.55%, to finish at 23723.69. The S&P 500 lost 81.72 points, or 2.81%, to close at 2830.71, and the
        Nasdaq Composite
      fell 284.60 points, or 3.20%, to end at 8604.95.Investors might be spooked by tensions flaring up between the U.S. and China. The Office of the Director of National Intelligence, which coordinates the work of 17 U.S. spy agencies, said in an unusual public statement that U.S. intelligence are investigating whether or not the coronavirus outbreak was the result of a laboratory accident in Wuhan, China. The organization said that intelligence agencies concur the broad scientific consensus that the Covid-19 virus was not man-made or genetically modified. President Donald Trump threatened to impose tariffs to retaliate against Beijing over its handling of the pandemic.Latest economic data also offered more clues on how the coronavirus pandemic has impacted American businesses. The Institute for Supply Management’s Manufacturing Purchasing Managers’ Index fell to 41.5 points in April, from 49.1 in the prior month. While the headline reading came better than what economists had expected, the new orders and production components of the survey showed the steepest declines, to 27.1 and 27.5, respectively. Levels below 50 signify a contraction.Earnings continued to drive many of Friday’s individual stock moves.
            Apple
      (ticker: AAPL) stock fell 1.6%—despite better-than-expected first-quarter earnings—after the company said it will not issue second-quarter financial guidance due to coronavirus-spurred uncertainty.
Amazon.com
      (AMZN) has seen a surge in demand and revenue as home-bound consumers are reliant on online shopping. Still, the stock dropped 7.6% on Friday as first-quarter profits came in lower than expected on the back of higher spending. CEO Jeff Bezos warned that the company expects to spend heavily in the second quarter due to Covid-19-related expenses, such as getting products to customers and keeping employees safe.Both stocks weigh heavily in the S&P 500 due to their massive market caps, and their fall today weighed on the index’s Friday performance.Looking past the headlines, though, the market’s fall on Thursday and Friday might be simply indicating investors’ fatigue from the recent relief rally. Market has recovered much ground from the late-February and early-March selloff, although the pandemic still looms large and many states remain under a shutdown. Stock valuations are flying high, as earnings prospects shrink, but equity prices didn’t follow. The market might be simply due for some reversion to the mean.The seasonality doesn’t help either. Statistically, the S&P 500 and Dow have each gained an average of about 5% during the November-to-April period since their inceptions, but only 2% from May through October—a historical tendency that’s coined the Wall Street adage “sell in May and go away.”Some investors may have done just that today.

10,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/amazon-exxon-mobil-earnings-weigh-211242115.html,2020-05-01T21:12:42.000Z,"Amazon, Exxon Mobil Earnings Weigh On Market To Start New Month As Caution Steers The Wheel","Look out, everyone. There’s a new month in town, and it’s not starting out very auspiciously for investors.After stocks enjoyed their best month since 1987 in April, May’s entrance reminded us of the harsh winds of March that we’d probably rather forget. The tech heavyweights that led things up are now kind of leading everything back down. It had been a great week up until yesterday, but the last two days wiped out most of the gains. Remember that old twist on the “light at the end of the tunnel” analogy, where the light turns out to be a freight train heading right at you? Maybe that’s how investors felt after Thursday and Friday’s collective selloff ran over the rally that had been gaining traction. Of course more positive news could happen any time to get hopes up again, there’s just no way to know.In a way, this week was the polar opposite of last, with selling late in the week following an early rally. There’s likely a bit of month-end profit taking playing into this, some technical pressure, and also some “sell the fact” unwinding following so many FAANG companies reporting. Those stocks rallied pretty hard through April and were looking a little overbought to some participants, so it’s not a shock to see them lose ground. The question is how much of this weakness ends up spilling over into next week, so you might want to consider taking a close look at the futures market Sunday night for clues. It’s also the first Friday in a while to suffer from the “Friday syndrome” that torched so many rallies earlier this year when many seemed cautious about carrying long positions into the weekend. One Friday doesn’t make a trend, but next Friday is payrolls day, so it could get interesting.Amazon Leading Tech LowerThe first victim of Friday’s plunge became evident in futures trading late Thursday after trillion-dollar club member Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ: AMZN) reported earnings. The company’s focus on billions of dollars in costs associated with the pandemic came as a bit of a reality check for the market, which had sent AMZN shares to all-time highs amid talk of how firm revenue looked.Some companies in the tech space have done great, and investors have heard anecdotally about sales but not about costs. All the anecdotal stories focused on revenue being through the roof, but AMZN’s earnings suggested it hasn’t all been profitable revenue growth, and that the current economic data is affecting these companies as well.The Information Technology sector is what led everything higher over the last month, and companies like Apple, Inc. (NASDAQ: AAPL), AMZN, and Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ: MSFT) are heavyweights that dominate the major indices. Their performance or lack thereof can have a huge impact on the overall market.AMZN had great revenues, but expenses went up at the same time and a lot of them were employee-related and front loaded, meaning they could hurt the company’s current quarter. AAPL, also fresh off its earnings report, might have worried investors by indicating they’re not sure how many iPhones they can sell in current conditions.To bring back another old friend some would rather forget, trade tensions with China reappeared in the headlines Friday as The Washington Post warned that the administration might be considering new trade restrictions as President Trump has begun blaming China for the pandemic. Geopolitics tied up the market for long stretches last year before yielding to the virus. Still, apparently we’re not out of the woods when it comes to the trade war. Volatility, which had died down pretty dramatically, surged on Friday with the Cboe Volatility Index (VIX) once again approaching 40 after falling to the low-30’s earlier in the week. This served as a reminder that things could remain choppy for a while, with so much unknown. The market was already lower Friday before Tesla, Inc. (NASDAQ: TSLA) CEO Elon Musk delivered a head-scratching statement about his company’s stock price being too high. It’s hard to think of any other CEO who’s ever said that, but Musk did and the stock suffered for it. This might serve as another reminder to investors about being careful what you get into. Fundamentals drive markets over the long term, so trading on emotions or headlines can be a double-edged sword. While the week ended and the month began on a sour note, let’s not forget some of the positive news that helped fuel the rally earlier this week. Positive news on drug trials and strong earnings from companies like MSFT, Facebook, Inc. (NASDAQ: FB), and Alphabet, Inc. (NASDAQ: GOOG) (NASDAQ: GOOGL) shouldn’t be forgotten so fast. Together, these three have trillions in market valuation and exert a really strong influence on the major indices.AAPL fell Friday despite the positive news that it plans to increase its dividend and continue buying back shares. The company also beat Wall Street’s consensus on earnings and revenue. Seeing this kind of news from what’s arguably the most closely watched company in the world could be taken as a sign of confidence that AAPL can weather the storm, as we noted this morning.The Depowered...Though AMZN and AAPL arguably led the charge lower beginning with yesterday's earnings releases, it's the Energy sector at the bottom of the sector leaderboard Friday.  Crude oil futures (/CL) had a decent day as the front-month U.S. contract clawed back to nearly $20 a barrel by the time trading closed. Still, Energy companies like Exxon Mobil Corporation (NYSE: XOM)—which reported earnings early Friday—and ConocoPhillips (NYSE: COP) both plunged around 7%. Phillips 66 (NYSE: PSX)—which also released this morning—fared even worse, with shares falling over 9%.Even though June crude futures are knocking on the door of $20, it could be hurting Energy firms that futures contracts farther out into the year have pretty much all descended from the $30’s into the $20’s over the last few weeks, a sign that investors might expect the supply/demand picture to stay out of balance for a while. In other words, no matter how you slice it, the oil services industry is in for a tough slog.  Energy had the worst day of any sector, falling 6%....and the TurboChargedWhile big tech and Energy stocks lost significant ground Friday, some of the companies that tend to have traded in the opposite direction of the tech behemoths made progress. Several major stocks had pretty decent days, one of them being The Clorox Company (NYSELCLX). That company had a great quarter like AMZN, but without the added employment and shipping expenses.Two other stocks that have traded against the grain recently are Walmart (NYSE: WMT) and Costco Wholesale Corporation (NASDAQ: COST). It’s amazing that every time the overall market goes down, these are two that people seem to turn to, and, as if on cue, they both turned up Friday. That’s been the story and it got a new chapter written Friday. However, it’s not necessarily the happiest story if you’re a bull, because those are the kinds of companies that sell staple products that typically do well when people are hunkering down in a crisis. It might be seen as a better indicator when you see companies in the travel and entertainment sectors do well, because that could point toward people having faith in this crisis starting to go away.The market is arguably in better shape from a technical perspective than it was back in March. Recent selloffs tended to get met with buying interest amid positive feelings that the Fed has investors’ backs. That said, the S&P 500’s (SPX) test and failure to break through its 200-day moving average earlier this week could have weighed on stocks Friday, along with a failure to stay above the 2940 area, which was about where a long-term top was reached in the fall of 2018 before everything fell out of bed in the final quarter of that year.We’re now about halfway through earnings season, and it’s like baseball great Yogi Berra once said, “You never know.” Investors just haven’t learned a ton from earnings. Only that there’s more costs and companies don’t know what’s ahead. That’s a strong reminder that we’re not out of the woods.One other interesting note and then you’re free to enjoy your weekend: The 10-year Treasury note did a pretty decent job hanging in above 0.6% this week, though that’s incredibly low historically. The fact that it didn’t challenge its all-time lows set back in March even as stocks fizzled Friday could be a positive sign heading into the new week.  CHART OF THE DAY: SPX HITS A HARD WALL. After the S&P 500 Index (SPX–candlestick) started moving higher than its 50% Fibonacci retracement level, all eyes were at the next resistance level—61.8%. It reached that level on Wednesday, went slightly above it, and then hit its 200-day exponential moving average (blue line). That was a hard wall to break through. SPX has moved lower since then and is now heading toward its 50% retracement level. Data Source: S&P Dow Jones Indices.

""But it could be a longer and deeper valley than many hoped.""Indeed, stocks had a remarkable run in April, with the S&P 500 and the Dow both posting their strongest monthly percentage gains in 33 years.Trump said his administration was crafting retaliatory measures against China as punishment for the coronavirus outbreak, once again sparking tariff fears that rattled markets through much of the last two years. Trump has blamed China for what he says is ""misinformation"" when the virus emerged from the Chinese city of Wuhan and then quickly spread around the world.""Trump poking China was the last thing markets needed given so much present economic and financial uncertainty,"" Carter added.A mixed bag of earnings, particularly a disappointing report from Amazon.com, along with a fresh round of dismal economic data, also weighed on sentiment.U.S. manufacturing activity skidded to an 11-year low last month as lockdowns shuttered factories, according to the Institute for Supply Management's purchasing managers index.The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 622.03 points, or 2.55%, to 23,723.69, the S&P 500 lost 81.72 points, or 2.81%, to 2,830.71, and the Nasdaq Composite dropped 284.60 points, or 3.2%, to 8,604.95.All 11 sectors of the S&P 500 closed in the red, with energy companies suffering the largest percentage drop.The corporate reporting season has crossed the midpoint, with 275 of the companies in the S&P 500 having reported quarterly results. Of those, 68% have beaten consensus estimates.In aggregate, first-quarter S&P 500 earnings are seen having fallen 12.7% from a year ago, a stark reversal from the 6.3% annual growth forecast that stood on Jan. 1.Tesla Inc plunged 10.3% after company Chief Executive Elon Musk said in a tweet that the electric car maker's stock price was ""too high.""Amazon.com shares slid 7.6% after the online retailer warned pandemic-related expenses could lead to its first quarterly loss in five years.Apple Inc's quarterly results beat expectations, but the iPhone maker declined to provide current-quarter forecasts. Its shares lost 1.6%.Exxon Mobil dropped 7.2% after the company reported a drop in profit due to a massive $3 billion writedown on plummeting oil demand and prices.Rival Chevron Corp posted a 38% profit increase, boosted by asset sales, and slashed spending plans. Its shares dipped 2.8%.Declining issues outnumbered advancing ones on the NYSE by a 5.23-to-1 ratio; on Nasdaq, a 4.40-to-1 ratio favored decliners.The S&P 500 posted no new 52-week highs and two new lows; the Nasdaq Composite recorded 17 new highs and 12 new lows.Volume on U.S. exchanges was 10.17 billion shares, compared with the 12.19 billion average over the last 20 trading days.

Renewed tensions between the U.S. and China played a role too after U.S. intelligence agencies confirmed that they are investigating whether or not the coronavirus outbreak was the result of a laboratory accident in Wuhan. President Donald Trump threatened to impose tariffs to retaliate against Beijing over its handling of the coronavirus.And after a multi-week 30% rally, stocks may have simply been due for some reversion to the mean. The
        Dow Jones Industrial Average
      closed down 622 points, or 2.6%. The
        S&P 500
      and
        Nasdaq Composite
      fell 2.8% and 3.2%, respectively. The small-cap Russell 2000 index dropped 4.1%.Oil settled higher, with West Texas Intermediate crude up 5% to $19.78 a barrel. Markets in Germany, Italy, Spain and a number of other continental countries are closed for the Labor Day holiday. However, the FTSE 100 extended Thursday’s heavy losses, sliding 2.3%.Friday’s drop in the U.S. comes after the S&P 500 posted the best month in 33 years in April, even as the pandemic cut deeply into corporate profits and hit economic activity. The index has made back the majority of its late February and early March losses.Dire economic indicators continued to pile up on Friday. The Institute for Supply Management’s Manufacturing Purchasing Managers’ Index for April showed a drop to 41.5 points, from 49.1 in the prior month. The new orders and production components of the survey showed the steepest declines, to 27.1 and 27.5, respectively. Levels below 50 signify a contraction.Haven assets were mixed on Friday. The price of gold rose 0.9% to $1,709.70 an ounce. The yield on the 10-year U.S. Treasury note ticked up 2 basis points, or hundredths of a percentage point, to 0.642%, as the price of the securities slipped. The U.S. Dollar Index (DXY)—which measures the greenback against a basket of other currencies—ended about flat.The Cboe Volatility Index, or Vix, surged 9% on Friday, to over 37 points, as it rebounded from its lowest levels since February in recent days. The Vix is still well below the string of closes in the 70s and 80s seen in March.Earnings continued to dominate many of Friday’s individual stock moves.
Apple
      shares (ticker: AAPL) fell 1.6%. The company reported better-than-expected financial results Thursday, but said it would not issue financial forecasts for the second quarter due to coronavirus-spurred uncertainty. 
Amazon
      (AMZN) shares dropped 7.6% after the company reported first-quarter profits that were below expectations on Thursday evening. Chief executive Jeff Bezos warned that the company expects to have to spend heavily in the second quarter to get products to consumers and keep employees safe during the pandemic. 
Clorox
      (CLX) stock climbed 2.9% after its earnings release because demand for disinfectants and other cleaning products has surged. The company reported a 15% increase in sales during its fiscal third quarter and a 31% increase in earnings per share. Clorox also updated its fiscal 2020 outlook and is now projecting sales growth in the range of 4% to 6%.—Callum Keown contributed to this article.

But Apple stock dipped Friday amid a down market.The Cupertino, Calif.-based company mixed bad news with the good in its fiscal second-quarter report late Thursday. Leading the negative news was a 6.7% year-over-year drop in iPhone revenue as the coronavirus pandemic hit production and consumer demand for smartphones. Apple iPad and Mac computer sales also fell in the quarter.Plus, Apple didn't give sales and earnings guidance for the June quarter, due to uncertainty from the ongoing Covid-19 pandemic and a likely recession. It was the first time in more than a decade that Apple didn't give quarterly guidance.On the positive side, Apple increased its cash dividend by 6% to 82 cents a share. The board of directors also authorized an increase of $50 billion to the existing share repurchase program, bringing the current stock buyback authorization to over $90 billion.Get these newsletters delivered to your inbox & more info about our products & services. Privacy Policy & Terms of UseOn the stock market today, Apple stock fell 1.6% to 289.07 as major indexes plunged. Earlier in the session, it was up as much as 1.8% to 299.On Wednesday, Apple stock broke out of a second-stage cup-with-handle base at a buy point of 288.35, according to IBD MarketSmith charts. On Friday, it remained in the 5% chase zone of its breakout.At least 10 Wall Street firms raised their price targets on Apple stock after the earnings report. However, three firms cut their price targets.Apple earned $2.55 a share, up 4% year over year, on sales of $58.31 billion, up 1%, in its fiscal second quarter ended March 28. Analysts were looking for Apple earnings of $2.26 a share on sales of $54.54 billion.On a conference call with analysts, Chief Executive Tim Cook said the company's online store had a ""phenomenal quarter"" after Apple shut its retail stores to prevent the spread of Covid-19.Before the retail store closures, Apple was on track for a record fiscal second quarter for product sales, based on the first five weeks of the quarter, Cook said.Apple's services segment was the star performer in the March quarter, with revenue up 16.6% to $13.35 billion. Since services have a higher profit margin, that boosted earnings as well. Services had a gross margin of 65.4% last quarter, vs. 30.3% for products. The company's total gross margin was 38.4%.Within the services segment, the App Store, Apple Music, video and cloud services posted all-time revenue records in the March quarter, Chief Financial Officer Luca Maestri said on the call.JPMorgan analyst Samik Chatterjee called Apple stock a ""top pick"" in a note to clients Friday. He reiterated his overweight rating on Apple stock and raised his price target to 350 from 335.He sees improving iPhone sales thanks to the introduction of the lower-cost iPhone SE in late April and the 5G iPhones coming this fall. The company also has ""underappreciated leverage"" to the work-from-home and online learning trends, which should benefit iPad and Mac sales, Chatterjee said.Jefferies analyst Kyle McNealy said investors likely will look past March-quarter results and focus on the 5G iPhone upgrade cycle.""The pending 5G cycle is still the biggest catalyst for Apple moving forward,"" McNealy said in his report to clients. ""We expect the 5G cycle to bring significant upgrade activity.""McNealy forecasts Apple to sell 212 million iPhones in its fiscal 2021, which starts Sept. 27. Analysts on average expect sales of 205 million iPhones, he said.McNealy kept his buy rating on Apple stock and upped his price target to 350 from 320.Eric Ross, chief investment strategist for Cascend Securities, called the lack of guidance for the June quarter ""unnerving.""""We had expected guidance because every other tech company has provided guidance, albeit with a wider range,"" Ross said in his note.Ross maintained his buy rating on Apple stock but lowered his price target to 325 from 350.Apple stock was on IBD's SwingTrader list of actionable stocks on Friday.
